# High-Performance DC Power Supply Design Based on Flyback Topology

## Project Overview

This repository contains the design and implementation of a high-performance DC power supply based on the flyback topology. The project includes learning notes, PSIM simulation files, and JLCPCB PCB design files.

## Design Specifications

1. Input DC Voltage Range: Nominal 24VDC (18-30VDC)
2. Output DC Voltage/Current: 
   - +5V/1A
   - +15V/0.3A
3. Transformer Core: EE20
4. Output Voltage/Current Ripple: â‰¤ 5%

## Circuit Design
For more detial of the circuit design,please cheack the `Schematics` folder.

The power supply design incorporates the following stages:

1. AC-DC Conversion: 220V 50Hz AC is stepped down to a lower voltage.
2. EMI Filtering: Reduces electromagnetic interference.
3. Full-Bridge Rectification: Converts AC to pulsating DC.
4. Flyback Converter: Main power conversion stage.
5. Clamping and Filtering: Limits output voltages to 5V and 15V.
6. Voltage Sampling: Optically isolated voltage sampling circuit.
7. Control: Utilizes the UC3842 chip for regulation and control.
